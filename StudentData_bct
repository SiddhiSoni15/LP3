theory
In Ethereum, a smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain, allowing storage and retrieval of structured data securely.
This experiment demonstrates the creation of a Student Record Management System using Solidity constructs such as Structures, Arrays, and a Fallback function.
A structure (struct) is used to define the student data type with fields like name, roll number, and marks.
An array is used to store multiple student records on the blockchain.
The fallback() function in Solidity is a special function that executes automatically when Ether is sent to the contract or when an undefined function is called.
It ensures the contract can safely handle unexpected transactions and log them.
The contract is deployed on an Ethereum test network (Remix VM or Sepolia), and each operation (adding data, calling fallback) consumes gas, which can be observed in Remix.
This experiment introduces how data structures and blockchain storage combine to create decentralized applications (DApps).

Algorithm
Define a Student structure containing:
name (string)
rollNumber (uint)
marks (uint).
Create an array to store multiple student records.
Define a function addStudent() to add new student data to the array.
Define a function getStudent() to retrieve student data by index.
Implement a fallback() function to handle unexpected transactions or Ether transfers.
Deploy the contract on Remix IDE (using JavaScript VM or Sepolia).
Observe Gas usage and Transaction fee for adding and retrieving student records

The StudentData Smart Contract was successfully created and deployed using Solidity.
It demonstrates the use of Structures (for data organization), Arrays (for dynamic storage), and Fallback functions (for handling unexpected calls).
The fallback function was triggered when Ether was sent to the contract or an undefined function was called.
Gas consumption was observed for different operations — storage and function calls consumed more gas compared to read-only calls.
This experiment illustrates how smart contracts manage structured data and react to external interactions securely on the Ethereum blockchain.

Operation	    Gas Used	Remarks
Deploy Contract	~148,000	Storage allocation
addStudent()	~45,000	    Write to blockchain
getStudent()	0 (view)	Read-only call
fallback()	    ~22,000	    Default function triggered
